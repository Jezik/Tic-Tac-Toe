# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple variant of a console Tic-Tac-Toe game

You need two players to play a game. Every player enters two coordinates of a cell to enter 'X' or 'O'

The coordinates on a field are:

13 23 33

12 22 32

11 21 31

First turn is for 'X', the second - 'O' and so on.
The program tracks a game state and has three possible endings: X win, O win or a Draw
